<br>
<p style="font-size:18px">Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas which is emitted through various human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation along with natural processes like volcanic eruptions. <br>
CO2 emissions release carbon dioxide molecules into the atmosphere which tends to trap the heat that comes from the sun. This causes the global temperature to rise as the heat that is trapped by this gas <br>
is unable to escape causing devastating problems like the freezing of ice caps to unpredictable and extreme weather conditions. This phenomena is referred to as global warming which has disturbed the natural <br>
eco-system effecting the way all living creatures live their life as well as all natural process overall. Countries around the world and organizations have identified climate change as the most urgent threat we face <br>
and have put into action many plans to lower CO2 emission levels, let us take a closer look at the overall trend and other contributing factors to the problem we currently face.

<p style="font-size:30px">CO2 Emissions  over the course of history</p>

<br>
<p style="font-size:18px">Over the past 100 years, human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by 47% above pre-industrial levels found in 1850. This contirbution is more than the CO2 emissions <br> 
that occur naturally. The current concentration of CO2 is approximately 415 ppm (parts per million). To put it into perspective, the total increase in concentration over 20,000 years up till 1850 was from 185 ppm<br>
to 280 ppm. Following is a visualisation of the CO2 emissions from right after the Industrial revolution, all the way to the modern age. The emission is measured in millions of tonnes.</p>
